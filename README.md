# Students-Performance-Analysis

## üéØ Problem Statement

The education board aims to understand whether attending a test preparation course has a measurable impact on student performance in exams. Specifically, the goal is to investigate whether there is a statistically significant difference in math scores between students who completed the test preparation course and those who did not. This analysis will help determine the effectiveness of such courses and support decisions around implementing or improving preparatory programs in the curriculum.

## üìä Project Objectives

- Analyze score distributions across math, reading, and writing subjects.
- Compare performance based on gender, parental education, and test preparation status.
- Identify score correlations.
- Validate assumptions through statistical testing and visualizations.
- Derive insights useful for educational policy and curriculum design.

## üîç Key Findings

- **Test Preparation Impact:**  
  Students who completed the test preparation course scored higher on math exams on average, suggesting a positive impact.

- **Gender Differences:**  
  Males showed slightly higher math scores, while females performed better in reading and writing.

- **Correlation Insights:**  
  Reading and writing scores have a strong positive correlation, indicating performance consistency in language-related subjects.

- **Score Distributions:**  
  Visual analysis showed near-normal distributions for most scores, validated through histograms and Q-Q plots.
