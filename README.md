# üéì Students Performance Analysis

## üìå Problem Statement
The education board seeks to determine whether attending a **test preparation course** significantly impacts students‚Äô exam performance, specifically in **math scores**. This study aims to evaluate if test preparation leads to measurable academic improvement, guiding decisions on curriculum enhancements and educational support programs.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Analyze score distributions in **Math**, **Reading**, and **Writing**.
- Compare performance by **gender**, **parental education**, and **test preparation status**.
- Examine **correlations** between subjects.
- Conduct **statistical tests** and visual analysis to validate assumptions.
- Provide **actionable insights** for educational policy and curriculum planning.

## üîç Key Insights & Outcomes
- Students who completed the test preparation course scored significantly higher in math than those who did not, indicating a positive impact of test preparation.
- There is a statistically significant difference in performance between the two student groups (Completed and None) based on test preparation status.
- Math and reading scores are not normally distributed, suggesting that student performance data may often be skewed or unevenly spread.
- The difference in math scores between groups (Completed and None) is not due to random chance, but reflects a real, measurable effect.
- The analysis supports the importance of preparation and study support programs in improving academic outcomes.
- Boys and girls may show slight differences in math scores, based on the gender-based box plots.
- Students who perform well in one subject (like reading) often do well in others (like writing or math), showing a strong link between skills.
- The visualizations like box plots helped us clearly see the score differences between groups.
- There may be underlying variability in how students perform across subjects, which is influenced by factors like preparation, effort, or access to resources.
